For the skype icons:

http://blogs.skype.com/2006/09/01/icons-and-strings

A few days ago, Peter Kalmström wrote about more than 2600 Skype UI strings having been made available to the developers in 27 languages. Today, we have also published over 100 Skype icons in 5 sizes.

All these components are licensed under Skype Component License which allows everybody to use them in their applications free of charge as long as they follow some simple and reasonable restrictions, like using the icons and strings only in the original context, not allowing their applications to do anything evil, and making sure their users can get in touch with them if needed.

UPDATE on 2006-09-13: Skype Emoticons are now available under the same license.

]]>We wanted the license to be as permissive as possible. As most of our example code is already available under the BSD license, we have considered using the same license for the icons and strings.

However, we decided to create a new license for three main reasons. First, icons and strings are non-functional components; they are not code and therefore any source code license would not be appropriate for them. Second, we didn’t want them to be modified in any way. And third, we decided to reserve the right to revoke the license if a developer does something harmful to the Skype user community. We are confident, though, that the developers are reasonable folk, and we have good reasons believe that we’ll never have to actually revoke this license.
